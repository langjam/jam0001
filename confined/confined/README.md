# Confined

```
make all
./bin/confined.out maths.confined
```

# Language Features and Notes
* Unicode is supported! Emojis can be used as identifiers.
* Operator precedence is not supported. So 3 * 3 + 1 will result in 3 * (3 + 1) instead of (3 * 3) + 1
* Common operators can be replaced with 'plus', 'minus', 'divided_by', 'multiplied_by' and 'equals'
