# commentrace

> a language featuring a comment trace, written during a comment race

Hacked together in the last 4 hours of the jam.

## Usage

1. Install node/npm.
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run start <file> [input]`

## About

Write beautifully-commented pseudo-code, and get a trace of the execution of the code.

Example fizz buzz program:
```
# We'll interpret the input as a number, and set that as the max.
$max = toNumber($input)
# In this case, the max is $max.

# We'll initialize i, our index, to 0.
$i = 0

# We'll also keep a string accumulator for our output.
$str = ""

# Then, we'll enter a loop:
repeat:
  # Now, we'll increase i.
  $i = $i + 1
  # In this iteration, i is $i. Is that too much? (the max is $max)
  if $i > $input:
    # It is too much! We'll output the string that's been accumulated.
    return $str
  else:
    # Good news: it's not!
    # Now we'll check if i is a multiple of 3.
    if $i % 3 == 0:
      # It is! Let's now check if it's a multiple of 5.
      if $i % 5 == 0:
        # Look at that -- it's also a multiple of 5!
        # We'll add "FizzBuzz" (and a trailing newline!) to our output accumulator.
        $str = $str + "FizzBuzz\n"
      else:
        # It's not. That's ok, we'll just add "Fizz" (and the ever-important newline) to the output.
        $str = $str + "Fizz\n"
    else:
      # It's not. But is it a multiple of 5?
      if $i % 5 == 0:
        # It is! That means we'll add "Buzz" (and a newline!) to the output accumulator.
        $str = $str + "Buzz\n"
      else:
        # It isn't. That means we have to add just "$i" (and a newline, of course) to the string. Bo-ring.
        $str = $str + $i + "\n"
```

Output:
```
We'll interpret the input as a number, and set that as the max.
In this case, the max is 100.
We'll initialize i, our index, to 0.
We'll also keep a string accumulator for our output.
Then, we'll enter a loop:
  Now, we'll increase i.
  In this iteration, i is 1. Is that too much? (the max is 100)
    Good news: it's not!
    Now we'll check if i is a multiple of 3.
      It's not. But is it a multiple of 5?
        It isn't. That means we have to add just "1" (and a newline, of course) to the string. Bo-ring.
  Now, we'll increase i.
  In this iteration, i is 2. Is that too much? (the max is 100)
    Good news: it's not!
    Now we'll check if i is a multiple of 3.
      It's not. But is it a multiple of 5?
        It isn't. That means we have to add just "2" (and a newline, of course) to the string. Bo-ring.
  Now, we'll increase i.
  In this iteration, i is 3. Is that too much? (the max is 100)
    Good news: it's not!
    Now we'll check if i is a multiple of 3.
      It is! Let's now check if it's a multiple of 5.
        It's not. That's ok, we'll just add "Fizz" (and the ever-important newline) to the output.
  Now, we'll increase i.
  In this iteration, i is 4. Is that too much? (the max is 100)
    Good news: it's not!
    Now we'll check if i is a multiple of 3.
      It's not. But is it a multiple of 5?
        It isn't. That means we have to add just "4" (and a newline, of course) to the string. Bo-ring.
