# Pancake

The pancake programming language is a stack machine language with the following characteristics.
 * There are two instruction streams: commented and un-commented.
 * Users can conditionally (`flip_if`) or unconditionally (`flip`) switch between them.
 * The execution continues from the beginning when it reaches the end.
