* Recursive fibonacci to get the nth number in the sequence
// less is not here this is big
// sub is not here this is big
// add is not here this is big
// fib is with n
// still in fib one is 1
// still in fib two is 2
n.two // still in fib cond is less
n // still in fib if cond return is
(n.one)..(n.two). // still in fib return is sub then fib then sub then fib then add

* fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
// a is 10
a. // return is fib
