# BF Examples

This folder contains two `boros` implementations of a Brainfuck interpreter.

* [`BFSimple.brs`](BFSimple.brs) is the simple interpreter.
* [`BF.brs`](BF.brs) uses the *first-class comments* mechanism.

There's also 2 BF programs for testing: [`Hello World`](HelloWorld.bf) and [`Sierpinski Triangle`](Triangle.bf).
