## Team Daily Dose's LangJam Entry

Thanks, doc.

# SmallComment

A language where comments are the only first-class data type. Kind of.

## Requirements

All you need is git, cmake, ninja and a working C++ compiler.

## Build Instructions

Run `BuildTheThing.sh`. The executable will be at `Build/smcc`. You can use
various options, see `Build/smcc --help`. You can then run the included example
with `Build/smcc example.smc`.
