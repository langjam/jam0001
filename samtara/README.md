# Leafr: Lookup Expressions And Find Rewrites

Leafr is a language based on pattern matching and string rewriting. Created for Langjam 2021 under the theme
"first-class comments", the language aims to treat comments as first class by allowing data to be provided
in the form of written prose.

It's inspired by [Refal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refal).

## How to Run

Leafr is written in Ruby 2.6.3.

  ```
  Usage: ruby all_of_it.rb [options]
    -r, --run FILE                   The path of a file to run

    -p, --play                       Play a terminal animation of the code running
