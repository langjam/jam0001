# Documentation generator

This program generates markdown documentation for its own source.
It does so by reading its own source, gathering up function definitions and
comments, and priting appropriate (and easy to get) info out.

You can recreate output file by running the command in this folder:

```shell
tontuna main.tnt --output output.md
```

* [Read the source](./main.tnt)
* [Take a look at the output](./output.md)
