## Another header i guess

This is a very good library, see benchmarks on <https://example.org>.
What _if_ **everyone** used **_this_** library? I think that would be pretty cool.

Well, maybe they shouldn't since it is a `naive` implementation.

```rust
let mut result = 0;
result = 2 + 2;
```

```rundown
global foo = "bar";
global a = 1;

fun doit() {
    goto "another-header-i-guess";
}

var b = a + 1;
a = a + 1;

if (b == 2) {
    doit();
}

print("foo");
sleep(5);
print("bar");
var x = read();
print(x);

```
